# Dramatron
I experimented with [Dramatron from DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/dramatron). 
- A story is an objective
- Screenwriters string them together

# Generative AI Industry
- Attened [The AI Conference](https://aiconference.com/) which was awesome however many of us couldn't escape the feeling of "[Selling pickaxes during a gold rush](https://cdixon.org/2011/02/05/selling-pickaxes-during-a-gold-rush)"

# Use Cases that just might be viable
- None Player Characters (NPCs) - The value add here is pretty clear and a few startups have picked up on this opportunity. I do wonder how difficult it is to escape being little more than an LLM wrapper? What could such a startup provide that I couldn't in crafting a prompt for an LLM? But contemplating the use case reminded me how I prefer movies over TV series because of the focus on character. Even with my LLM Screenwriting project I like how the bar is high. I use the example oh how people may not like Mob characters but given the plot of The Godfather will pull almost anyone in, rely on characters and you're risking losing your audiuence.
