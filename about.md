I'm a dreamer and hardcore editor. My forte lies in recognizing the futility of an ineffective strategy and swiftly altering course. This mindset shields me from the trap of insanity, embodying the principle that repeating the same actions and anticipating different outcomes is a road to madness.

This relentless drive fuels my role as a Product Manager in the heart of Silicon Valley. When your utmost responsibility is to ensure what the team is building meets a real need, each day is a new game, a new chance to learn, grow, and go big. 

# About this blog
When learning a new programming language, a widely-accepted piece of advice from seasoned programmers is, to begin with a self-driven project. Finding myself, like many, mesmerized by Generative AI last year, I heeded this advice and set myself a challenge: Can Generative AI craft 'The Great Hollywood Screenplay'? 

This challenge, however, comes with a twist of skepticism. I am not convinced that Generative AI possesses the capacity to meet such an audacious demand. While I acknowledge its prowess in creating good screenplays, the Hollywood landscape is already inundated with "good". What Hollywood, what viewers yearn for is the 'great' - an elusive level of brilliance that sets a screenplay apart.

> As an illustrative example of these limitations, imagine an LLM trained on music up to the year 1900, but not after. Would it ever invent jazz? No. If you asked it to put together West African rhythms with classical-music chord progressions, it might come up with some sort of polyrhythmic Mozart but it wouldn't come up with Duke Ellington or John Coltrane.

(ChatGPT for the pithy line) Remember, success is not always the final destination; the wisdom and growth acquired along the journey can often hold greater value.
