# About me
I'm a dreamer who also happens to be a hardcore editor. And I dream about writing the great Hollywood screenplay, merging the knowledge network in my head with an LLM, being a great fencer... 

I use the term 'editor' over 'focus' as it better captures the humanistic side of dreaming. Knowing when something isn't working is the key to great writing. Actually, it's knowing and **admitting** when something isn't working that is key. Editing is the yin to the yang of dreaming. Editing empowers focus.

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”

Lucky enough for me, dreaming and editing is also my day job as a Product Manager in Silicon Valley, where my utmost responsibility is to ensure what the team is building meets a real need.

# About this blog - Trying to unlock Generative AI's System 2 thinking through screenwriting
Being fascinated by Generative AI and LLMs I have also been caught up in the idea of pushing them to [System 2 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow). The keys to exploring this I believe, are narrowing of domain and the reward function. For me, that domain will be 'screenwriting'. The reward function and everything else is up in the air. But at the moment the goal might best be defined as: Push Generative AI beyond predicting the next best word or line of dialogue to predicting the next best scene. You will understand why this is a true challenge if you're a screenwriter.
